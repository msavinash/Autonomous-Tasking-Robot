# Autonomous Tasking Robot

## Overview
This project involves the development of an autonomous Raspberry Pi robot that can transport target objects from a source to a destination. The robot is equipped with computer vision technology that allows it to detect the location and color of target objects, which enables it to accurately pick them up and transport them.

## Technologies Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Python
- Computer Vision
- Robotics

## Features
- Implemented color segmentation and Contour Detection to extract location and color of target objects, achieving an accuracy of 85%
- Developed a system using Python to ensure the bot can identify and pick up different colored targets from a mixed set and transport them to their corresponding destination with an accuracy of 90%

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script `main.py`

## Usage
1. Set up the Raspberry Pi robot and ensure it is connected to the same network as the computer running the script
2. Run the script `main.py`
3. The robot should now be able to detect and transport target objects
